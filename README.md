# IVMDCMS - InuitViking MarkDown Content Management System

I go tired of the lack of possibilities out there; there are many, but none that fix exactly mine.

## Dependencies
- [league/commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark)
- [clickfwd/yoyo](https://github.com/clickfwd/yoyo)
- [scssphp/scssphp](https://scssphp.github.io/scssphp/)
- [editor.md](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md)

[Little guide for scssphp.](https://awhitepixel.com/blog/compile-scss-with-php-add-variables-to-wordpress-customizer/)

## Goal
Create a simple markdown blog editor thing in PHP.
