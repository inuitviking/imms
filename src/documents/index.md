# Welcome

Thank you for choosing IVMDCMS!

It is a stand-in replacement for the other markdown CMSs out there, but currently not as feature-rich as the others.

Take a look at the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/InuitViking/ivmdcms) on the repository or in the project root for full list of goals.

## Features

The features are those of commonmark; plan is to expand. The libraries that have been chosen and the future editor of choice are expandable, so hoping to get to that sooner or later.
