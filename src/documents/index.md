# Welcome to IVMDCMS
It stands for "InuitViking MarkDown Content Management System". Quite a tongue twister.

It's not exactly here to replace anything, but the creator of this CMS just a little tired of the current possibilities, so he made his own.

The concept is *simple*. The code should be simple and "just work". The use of it should also be simple and "just work", while also being customisable.

## Features
The feature set should be very wide and the goal is to reach maximum markdown usage, including additional things, such as presentations.
